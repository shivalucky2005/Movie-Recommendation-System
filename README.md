# Movie Recommendation System

**Project Overview**
The Movie Recommendation System is designed to provide personalized movie suggestions to users based on their preferences. It leverages cosine similarity and vectorization techniques to find similarities between movies and recommend relevant titles. The system transforms movie data (genres, keywords, etc.) into vectors and compares them using cosine similarity to deliver accurate recommendations.

This project includes a web-based user interface built with Streamlit, offering a simple and interactive platform for users to explore personalized movie recommendations.

**Features**
Personalized Recommendations: Suggests movies based on user inputs, such as previously watched movies or selected genres.
Cosine Similarity: Measures the similarity between movies based on vectorized data.
Streamlit Frontend: Provides a clean, user-friendly interface for interaction.
Real-Time Results: Delivers movie suggestions instantly based on user preferences.

__Technologies Used__
Python: For the core logic and implementation.
Pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.
NumPy: For efficient numerical operations and vectorization.
Scikit-learn: For implementing cosine similarity and preprocessing.
Streamlit: For building the web-based frontend.

**How It Works**
Data Preprocessing: The dataset is cleaned and prepared using Pandas, extracting key features like genres, keywords, and ratings.
Vectorization: Movie metadata is converted into vectors using techniques such as TF-IDF or CountVectorizer.
Cosine Similarity: The similarity between vectors is calculated using cosine similarity to find movies with the closest features.
Recommendation Engine: Based on user input, the system finds and recommends movies with the highest similarity scores.
Frontend: The web interface built with Streamlit allows users to input their preferences and view movie recommendations in real time.

**Installations**
Clone the repository:
git clone (https://github.com/shivalucky2005/Movie-Recommendation-System.git)

Navigate to the project directory:
cd movie-recommendation-system

Install the required dependencies:
pip install numpy,
pip install pandas,
pip insatll streamlit,
pip install pickle

**Usage**
Run the Streamlit app:
streamlit run app.py
Input your preferences (movie you've watched or liked) and get instant movie recommendations.

**Future Enhancements**
Adding user authentication for personalized recommendation tracking.
Incorporating collaborative filtering for improved recommendation accuracy.
Expanding the dataset to include a broader range of movies and ratings.
